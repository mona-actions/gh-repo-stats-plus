# gh-repo-stats-plus

A TypeScript implementation for gathering GitHub repository statistics, including issues, pull requests, and more metrics to aid in repository analysis and migration planning. This project is a port of [mona-actions/gh-repo-stats](https://github.com/mona-actions/gh-repo-stats) from Bash to TypeScript, with significant enhancements and new features.

## Overview

gh-repo-stats-plus builds upon the solid foundation of the original gh-repo-stats project, reimplementing it in TypeScript to unlock additional capabilities and modern development patterns. While preserving the core functionality of collecting comprehensive statistics about repositories within a GitHub organization, this implementation introduces features like streaming processing, state persistence, and enhanced error handling to support larger organizations and more complex scenarios.

## Key Features

This TypeScript rewrite offers several advantages:

1. **Octokit SDK Integration**: Built on GitHub's official Octokit.js SDK, providing:

   - Token renewal
   - Built-in retries
   - Rate limit handling
   - Pagination
   - GraphQL and REST API support

2. **Streaming Processing with Async Generators**: Writes results incrementally as they're processed rather than collecting everything up front, resulting in better memory management and reliability.

3. **State Persistence**: Saves processing state to a `last_known_state.json` file after each successful repository, storing the current cursor position and processed repositories.

4. **Resume Capability**: Can resume operations from the last saved state in case of interruptions or failures.

5. **Smart Duplicate Avoidance**: Skips already processed repositories when resuming to prevent duplicates and save processing time.

6. **Advanced Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff strategy for retries to gracefully handle rate limits and transient errors.

7. **Enhanced Debugging**: Easier to debug and maintain with modern TypeScript development tools like VS Code.

8. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs stored in log files for later review and troubleshooting.

9. **Missing Repositories Detection**: Dedicated command to identify repositories that might have been missed during processing.

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mona-actions/gh-repo-stats-plus.git

## Debugging in VS Code

The project includes VS Code configurations for both running and debugging the application:

### Run Configurations

2. Make sure your `.env` file is set up with the necessary configuration noted in [environment variables](#environment-variables) above.
3. Open the Run and Debug sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on macOS)
4. Select one of the following debug configurations:

   - **repo-stats Debug**: Run and debug the repo-stats command
   - **missing-repos Debug**: Run and debug the missing-repos command
   - **Jest Current File**: Debug tests for the currently open file
   - **Jest All Tests**: Debug all tests in the project

5. Press F5 or click the green play button to start debugging

### VS Code Tasks

The project includes several VS Code tasks for building and testing:

   npm start repo-stats -- -o <org-name> -t <github-token>
   ```

2. **GitHub App**:
   ```bash
   npm start repo-stats -- -o <org-name> --app-id <app-id> --private-key-file <key-file> --app-installation-id <installation-id>
   ```

## State Management

The gh-repo-stats-plus application implements a state management system that tries to help ensure data accuracy when handling large GitHub organizations:

### Last Known State

All processing state is persisted in a `last_known_state.json` file after each successful repository is processed. This state file contains:

- **currentCursor**: Current pagination cursor being processed in GitHub's GraphQL API
- **lastSuccessfulCursor**: Last known successful pagination cursor (used for resuming)
- **processedRepos**: Array of repository names that have been successfully processed
- **lastProcessedRepo**: The most recently processed repository
- **lastUpdated**: Timestamp of the last state update
- **completedSuccessfully**: Flag indicating if the entire process completed without errors
- **outputFileName**: Path to the CSV output file being generated

### Resume Capability

When running with the `--resume-from-last-save` flag, the application:

1. Loads the existing state from `last_known_state.json`
2. Skips already processed repositories to avoid duplicates
3. Continues from the last successful cursor position
4. Uses the same output file to append new results

This feature is particularly valuable when:

- Processing large organizations with thousands of repositories
- Recovering from network interruptions or API rate limits
- Continuing work after system maintenance or restarts

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Initial run
npm start repo-stats -- -o your-org

# If interrupted, resume where you left off
npm start repo-stats -- -o your-org --resume-from-last-save
```

The application will automatically detect any already processed repositories, resume from the last position in the API pagination, and continue adding results to the existing CSV file.

## Permissions

The permissions needed by gh-repo-stats-plus depends on the authentication method:

### For Personal Access Token (PAT):

- `repo`: Full control of private repositories
- `read:org`: Read organization membership
- `read:user`: Read user information

### For GitHub App:

The app requires `Read-only` permissions to the following:

- Repository Administration
- Repository Contents
- Repository Issues
- Repository Metadata
- Repository Projects
- Repository Pull requests
- Organization Members

## Output

The tool generates:

1. A CSV file with repository statistics
2. A `last_known_state.json` file with the current processing state
3. Log files in the `logs/` directory

### CSV Output Columns

The CSV output includes detailed information about each repository:

- `Org_Name`: Organization login
