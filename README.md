# gh-repo-stats-plus

A GitHub CLI extension for gathering comprehensive repository statistics from GitHub organizations. This TypeScript implementation builds upon the solid foundation of [mona-actions/gh-repo-stats](https://github.com/mona-actions/gh-repo-stats), adding modern features and performance improvements for enterprise-scale repository analysis.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install the extension**:

   ```bash
   gh extension install mona-actions/gh-repo-stats-plus
   ```

2. **Authenticate with GitHub**:

   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Collect repository statistics**:
   ```bash
   gh repo-stats-plus repo-stats --organization my-org
   ```

The tool will generate a CSV file with comprehensive repository statistics for analysis.

## Key Features

This TypeScript rewrite offers several advantages:

1. **Octokit SDK Integration**: Built on GitHub's official Octokit.js SDK, providing:

   - Token renewal
   - Built-in retries
   - Rate limit handling
   - Pagination
   - GraphQL and REST API support

2. **Streaming Processing with Async Generators**: Writes results incrementally as they're processed rather than collecting everything up front, resulting in better memory management and reliability.

3. **State Persistence**: Saves processing state to a `last_known_state.json` file after each successful repository, storing the current cursor position and processed repositories.

4. **Resume Capability**: Can resume operations from the last saved state in case of interruptions or failures.

5. **Smart Duplicate Avoidance**: Skips already processed repositories when resuming to prevent duplicates and save processing time.

6. **Advanced Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff strategy for retries to gracefully handle rate limits and transient errors.

7. **Enhanced Debugging**: Easier to debug and maintain with modern TypeScript development tools like VS Code.

8. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs stored in log files for later review and troubleshooting.

9. **Missing Repositories Detection**: Dedicated command to identify repositories that might have been missed during processing.

## Technical Implementation

The extension is built using modern TypeScript patterns with:

- **Async Generators** for streaming large datasets
- **Retry Logic** with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limit Handling** via GitHub Octokit SDK
- **State Persistence** for resumable operations
- **Comprehensive Logging** with Winston
- **Type Safety** throughout the codebase
- **On-demand Building** for clean installation without pre-built artifacts

## Common Usage Examples

### Basic Organization Analysis

```bash
gh repo-stats-plus repo-stats --organization my-org
```

### Resume Long-Running Collection

```bash
gh repo-stats-plus repo-stats --organization my-org --resume-from-last-save
```

### High-Volume Processing with GitHub App

```bash
gh repo-stats-plus repo-stats \
  --organization my-org \
  --app-id 12345 \
  --private-key-file app.pem \
  --app-installation-id 67890
```

### Find and Process Missing Data

```bash
gh repo-stats-plus missing-repos --organization my-org --file results.csv
gh repo-stats-plus repo-stats --organization my-org --auto-process-missing
```

#### Repo Stats Options

- `-o, --org-name <org>`: The name of the organization to process (Required)
- `-t, --access-token <token>`: GitHub access token
- `-u, --base-url <url>`: GitHub API base URL (Default: https://api.github.com)
- `--proxy-url <url>`: Proxy URL if required
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--app-id <id>`: GitHub App ID
- `--private-key <key>`: GitHub App private key
- `--private-key-file <file>`: Path to GitHub App private key file
- `--app-installation-id <id>`: GitHub App installation ID
- `--page-size <size>`: Number of items per page (Default: 10)
- `--extra-page-size <size>`: Extra page size (Default: 50)
- `--rate-limit-check-interval <seconds>`: Interval for rate limit checks (Default: 60)
- `--retry-max-attempts <attempts>`: Maximum number of retry attempts (Default: 3)
- `--retry-initial-delay <milliseconds>`: Initial delay for retry (Default: 1000)
- `--retry-max-delay <milliseconds>`: Maximum delay for retry (Default: 30000)
- `--retry-backoff-factor <factor>`: Backoff factor for retry delays (Default: 2)
- `--retry-success-threshold <count>`: Successful operations before resetting retry count (Default: 5)
- `--resume-from-last-save`: Resume from the last saved state
- `--repo-list <file>`: Path to file containing list of repositories to process (format: owner/repo_name)
- `--auto-process-missing`: Automatically process any missing repositories when main processing is complete

## Permissions

The permissions needed by repo-stats-ts depends on the authentication method:

### For Personal Access Token (PAT):

- `repo`: Full control of private repositories
- `read:org`: Read organization membership
- `read:user`: Read user information

### For GitHub App

The app requires `Read-only` permissions to the following:

- Repository Administration
- Repository Contents
- Repository Issues
- Repository Metadata
- Repository Projects
- Repository Pull requests
- Organization Members

## Output

The tool generates:

1. A CSV file with repository statistics
2. A `last_known_state.json` file with the current processing state
3. Log files in the `logs/` directory
